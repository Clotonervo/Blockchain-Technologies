Class Prep:
- Watched entirety of Lecture 1 video, as well as reviewed slides and took Quiz 1

Questions:
1. What are applications/examples of bad and good randomness?
2. What other examples can we use signatures for? Is it cryptocurrency exclusive?
3. What are the pros and cons of the availabiltiy that comes from creating unlimited identities?
4. Do Bitcoin coins have a long list of signatures whenever it is transfered?
I would like to review some of the basic stuff from lecture 1 if possible

Summary:
	There is a lot of different ways to keep cryptocurrency secure. Hashing is a very important part of keeping information secure and valid, and hash pointers are great ways to make tamper free data structures. Signatures are also a necessary way to keep identities a secret while also providing some sort of security that is necessary for transactions. One of the biggest problems a cryptocurrency needs to solve is that of double-spending, and also that of decentralization.
