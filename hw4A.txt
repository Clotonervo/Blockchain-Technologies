1. I watched the lecture and took the quiz

2. I want to talk more about exchanges, As I think I understand a little bit about them but I don't have a solid grasp.

3. This lecture was all about fluidity of bitcoin when it comes to the fiat currencies. A key function of Bitcoin is the fact that people can buy and sell bitcoin using global currency, and exchanges help people do that. There are some risks with exchanges though, but they are the same risks people take every day with banks. The exchange of bitcoin can also be viewed as the exchange of keys. Hot and cold storages are both ways for people to gain security in transactions, while also keeping some fluidity when needed. This security is a very important part of cryptocurrency.
