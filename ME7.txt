I read chapter 7 for the homework

This chapter we talk specifically about smart contracts. Smart contracts are basic computer programs that cannot be changed as soon as they are executed, they are not legally binding. Smart contracts need to be written in high level languages, and I was surprised that there were so many languages that were supported and I have never heard of any of them. The tutorial for creating a contract in Solidity was also super informative, and it really was interesting to see just how similar it was to create a contract as it is to create a class in Java or something similar. While I was fairly confused about some of the linguistics they used, it all seemed fairly simple. I had a hard time following when it was talking about Facets and some of the other syntax, but I understood the gist of it.
