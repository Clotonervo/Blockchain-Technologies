I read the chapter for this assignment

This chapter talks about the EVM (Ethereum virtual Machine). The EVM is the part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution. It seems to be a similar aspect as the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), that helps ethereum run like it should and compile its smart contracts so they can be deployed on the blockchain. This chapter went indepth of the archiecture of the EVM. The different operations of the EVM seem pretty standard, there are add, subtract, your basic operations, but then there are some other things that I thought were weird to have, like SIGNEXTEND seemed interesting. It was interesting to read about all the different operations that it can support, and I really like the example of compiling the bytecode. It got kind of a lot near the end after reading about the different coding practicies and other things that I thought weren't super interesting, but over all I never knew that Ethereum had its own virtual machine. It does make sense though with the thought that Ethereum is a computation machine.
