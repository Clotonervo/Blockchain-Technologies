I watched the lecture and took the quiz

Also the majority of my time was used toward Assignment 2

I wouldn't mind talking a little more about the Assignment 2 as well as different kinds of altcoin. Maybe we could go into more detail as far as what cryptocurrencies are forked from bitcoin? I feel like there should be more than one coin that has forked from bitcoin.

This chapter we talk a lot about altcoins and their history. It wasn't for a few years that the first altcoin forked from bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies that have made have been pioneered by entrepreneurs and scammers alike trying to gain from the new technology. One of my favorite alt coins we read about was Dogecoin. It was also interesting leanring about the differences between bitcoin and altcoin.
