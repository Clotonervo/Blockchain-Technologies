I read the chapter for class

This chapter talks about Ethereum tokens. These tokens can be used for many different things, such as currency, asset, voting, identity and a few other functions. These tokens make up important building blocks for the cryptocurrency because of their many functions. Tokens are mainly used in one of two ways though, either as utility tokens or equity tokens. Utility tokens are those where the use of the token is required to gain access to a service, application, or resource. Examples of utility tokens include tokens that represent resources such as shared storage, or access to services such as social media networks. Equity tokens are those that represent shares in the control or ownership of something. While the chapter explains some more indepth functionality and logistics surrounding such tokens, it suffices to know the function of these tokens as a whole for this chapter.
