I think I did a very good job in consistently keeping up with the homework. I feel like a strength of mine included doing everything that needed to be done and turning it in on time. I think a weakness that I did have was that sometimes I didnâ€™t understand all the topics that were being taught in a super deep level, but I always was able to find a way to learn the basic knowledge of all the different concepts that were taught in class. I really feel like I put in a lot of effort to this course and that I really learned a lot in doing so.

I think that over all I deserve an A for this semester. I think that I did a very good job of learning the different topics and innerworkings of block chain this semester. I did all the homeworks and truly felt like I understood exactly what was being taught. I feel confident in my knowledge of blockchain, not only bitcoin and Ethereum, but also how to decipher and understand other altcoins and technologies that stem from the same topics that were covered in this class. I feel like with this knowledge I was rewarded for the work and time I put into this class.
