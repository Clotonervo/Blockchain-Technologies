Reading:
	Took a little bit to read and learn some stuff from the Bitcoin Whitepaper. It was very interesting and I was surprised at how much I understood as I read.

	Rewatched some of the lecture video to solidify understanding of proof of work, also went to the different sections that corresponded to the quiz questions so I understood more of the questions I missed.

Exercises:

5a) A miner can continue with a greater sense of randomness. If she is random enough, and uses different public keys, it will be harder for her to be linked to a public profile. If you also include random transactions in your blocks that you try and mine, then you will also keep your identity safe. 

5b) Theoretically yes, but because the mining pool is so big, and there is not a good way to accurately determine whether or not a person truly is who you think they are, in practice this is irrelevant.

6a) It is greater than 50%, because the majority of the blocks are actually mined before 10 minutes, as the probablility that a block is mined increases exponentially.

6b) For a 99% probability that 6 blocks are mined, Bob would have to wait over an hour. While you do have a pretty good chance of waiting an hour to get your payment, you are not 99% gaurenteed that you are at 6 blocks, because some blocks will be mined quicker and some slower.
